<h3>Pipe</h3>

<p>This <code>|</code> character is known as a pipe, and it allows us to take the output of one command and use that as the input for another command. This will make our base64 command much easier, because we would just have to run a command that can output the contents of a file and "pipe" it into the base64 command. To do this we can use the cat command for files, and the echo command for strings.</p>
